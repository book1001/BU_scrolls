      <h4>Scroll(s) Typeface</h4>
      <p>Developed by the 2025 BU Graphic Design MFA Visual Identity Team</p>
      <p>Scroll(s) is a custom display typeface developed for the 2025 Boston University MFA Graphic Design Thesis Exhibition. Drawing directly from the exhibition’s central metaphor of the scroll, the typeface is constructed from a motif inspired by digital scroll bars. Each letterform is built from modular bars that evoke the visual language of screen interfaces, while simultaneously referencing the physical structure of ancient scrolls.</p>
      <p>The typeface exists in all caps, with lowercase letters serving as alternate uppercase forms. These alternate characters are more deconstructed, suggesting motion and rhythm—echoing the exhibition’s exploration of fluidity, multiplicity, and continuous movement. Built from repeating elements that accumulate into singular forms, the typeface itself reflects a continuous stream. It is fluid yet structured, recursive yet adaptable. It invites discovery across the evolving border between digital and physical design.</p>

  <!-- <div id="words" class="typo1">
    <p>The web is like an endless garden, an invisible expanse where flowers are planted not with seeds, but with pixels and lines of code. This digital soil nurtures creations that bloom in vibrant forms, each one a testament to human thought and creativity. The links that connect these flowers stretch like vines, weaving an intricate network that binds each blossom to the next.</p>
    <p class="typo2">In this garden, the wind is made of data, carrying whispers of new stories from one corner to another. Leaves sway and petals tremble, reacting to the movements of algorithms, each subtle change creating ripples across the landscape. Underneath, the roots of information dig deep, invisible but essential, anchoring the entire garden in place.</p>
    <p>The sun here is an algorithm, shining relentlessly, illuminating patterns that shape the growth of this space. Instead of rain, the garden drinks from a steady stream of records—bits and bytes flowing endlessly, nourishing the digital soil. Every click, every interaction, becomes a drop of water, helping flowers bloom and grow stronger.</p>
    <p class="typo3">This garden is both virtual and real, a liminal space where imagination takes root and thrives. It is a place where creators plant their ideas, carefully tending to their growth, while visitors wander through, pausing to admire the blooms. Each flower carries the fingerprints of its maker, a trace of their thoughts and emotions embedded in its digital DNA.</p>
